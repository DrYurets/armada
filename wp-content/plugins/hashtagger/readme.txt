Allows you to use #hashtags, @usernames and $cashtags in your posts. #hashtags are automatically added as post tags. Highly customizable!

== Description ==

<strong>The [hashtagger Plugin](https://petersplugins.com/free-wordpress-plugins/hashtagger/) allows you to use #hashtags, @usernames and $cashtags in your posts</strong>

This plugin uses the [WordPress Tag system](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Tags_Screen) to automatically convert a #hashtag into a Post Tag. Each #hashtag is added as a "normal" tag (without leading hash) to the post, so it is fully compatible with existing tags!

= Usage =

Just type anywhere in a post

**#hashtag** 
This adds "hashtag" as tag to the current post and on links to tag archive page for "hashtag" when showing the post.

**+#hashtag** 
Use +#hashtag to only link to a tag archive page without adding "hashtag" as tag to the post. When showing the post the link is showed as "#hashtag" (without "+"). If the tag does not exist the text remains unchanged and no link is created.

**##hashtag**
Use duplicate ##hashes to tell the plugin that this word should not be converted into a tag. Duplicate hashes are replaced by a single hash when showing the post.

**@username**
This creates a link either to the Profile Page or the Website of User "username". The usage of @usernames can be activated optionally. If the username does not exist the text remains unchanged and no link is created. It is **highly recommended** to use @nicknames instead of @usernames to enhance security ([read more](https://petersplugins.com/docs/hashtagger/#usernames)).

**@@username**
Use @@username to avoid link creation. When showing the post this is displayed as "@username" without link (@username feature has to be activated).

**$cashtag**
This creates a link to the concerning stock symbol at MarketWatch, Google Finance or Yahoo Finance. The usage of $cashtags can be activated optionally. $cashtags link to the concerning stock symbol at MarketWatch, Google Finance or Yahoo Finance. **Notice**: stock symbols can not be validated, using a invalid stock symbol will cause an not found error on the target site.

**$$chashtag**
Use $$cashtag to avoid link creation. When showing the post this is displayed as "$cashtag" without link ($cashtag feature has to be activated).

= Docs & Support =

More detailed information about the hashtagger plugin can be found in the [Plugin Manual](https://petersplugins.com/docs/hashtagger/). For support check the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hashtagger).

= WordPress Security =

If you activate the @username feature **it is highly recommended to use @nickname instead of @username** ([read more](https://petersplugins.com/docs/hashtagger/#usernames))!

= Post Types and Section Types =

It is possible to use #hashtags, @usernames and $cashtags on Posts, on Pages and on Custom Post Types within Content, Title and Excerpt. Activate only the Post Types and Section Types you want to be processed to avoid unnecessary processing for best performance.

= Formatting links =

Additional CSS Class(es) to add to the #hashtag and @username links can be configured on the plugins setting page.

= Display of links in front end =

Optionally all symbols (#, @, $) can be removed from the links generated in front end.

= Display of Tags in front end =

There's an option to automatically add a hash symbol in front of tags (e.g. when using the Tag Cloud Widget).

== For developers ==

= Theme function =

Use `do_hashtagger( $content )` in your theme files to process #hashtags and @usernames in $content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What characters can a hashtag include? =

The hashtag detection follows the rules for hashtags on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. The minimum length for a hashtag is 2 characters. A hashtag must not start with a number (this can be changed optionally). A hashtag not only ends at a space but also at punctuation marks and other special characters. A hashtag may contain underscores.

= Does this also work for pages? =

Yes and No. Yes - the plugin can add the tags also for pages. No - WordPress does not show the tags section for pages and also pages are not listed on tag archives. 

This plugin does not change this behavior of WordPress because there already exist several plugins that add the tag functionality for pages. Please use one of them if you want to tag your pages.

= How to change the Tag base? =

The Tag base for the Tag Archive Page URL (e.g. example.com/**tag**/anytag) can be set on the 'Permalink Settings' page under 'Tag base' in your WP admin.

= Where does @username link to? =

This can be set on hashtagger Settings Page. @username links can either link to the Users Profile Page or to the Users Webiste (Users Profile Page if no Webpage is set). When linking to Users Website the link can be opened in a new window if desired.

= Why should I use @nicknames instead of @usernames =

This is important to enhance WordPress security. Please take a look at the [Manual](https://petersplugins.com/docs/hashtagger/#usernames).

= Can I use #hashtags and/or @usernames in Excerpts? =

Yes, just activate this feature.

= Can I use #hashtags and/or @usernames in Titles? =

Yes, just activate this feature.

= Can I regenerate all existing Posts after changing Settings? =

Yes, you can regenerate all affected objects (Post, Pages, Custom Posts) using the current settings.
